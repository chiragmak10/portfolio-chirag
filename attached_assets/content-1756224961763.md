Frequently asked questions

## Quick answers

What is your focus area?

I focus on User Experience (UX) and UI Design. With a strong background in visual design, making sure things not only work well but also look clean and easy to use.

How many years of experience do you have?

I bring over 5 years of hands-on experience, working across startups and enterprise-level companies on impactful digital products.

What design tools do you use?

I use Figma for most of my work. I also use Webflow, Adobe tools, and simple tools like Notion and FigJam to stay organised and share ideas.

How do you use AI in your work?

I use AI tools to speed up tasks like writing text, creating design ideas, and organising information. It helps me work faster and try more options before deciding on the final design.

Do you work alone or with others?

I have experience doing both. I’ve worked alone on full projects and also as part of a team with other designers, developers, and product managers.
